Managing IAM Resources Using Terraform

Welcome to our IAM Management repository! Here, you'll find Terraform code designed for efficiently handling IAM (Identity and Access Management) resources within AWS. This repository streamlines the process of automating tasks such as creating IAM users, roles, policies, as well as attaching users to groups and policies to groups.

Key Features:

- User Management: Simplify the creation of IAM users along with their associated access keys and login profiles.
- Group Management: Easily organize users by creating IAM groups and assigning permissions through group policies.
- Role Management: Define IAM roles tailored to specific permissions required by applications or services.
- Policy Management: Author IAM policies to precisely control access to AWS services and resources.
- Terraform Automation: Utilize Terraform's infrastructure as code (IaC) paradigm for consistent and repeatable provisioning of IAM resources.
